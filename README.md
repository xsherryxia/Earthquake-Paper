S.M.A.R.T Goals
===============
1) SPECIFIC

- Cache and send out the data to the analyzers and other groups 
  - [CleanData1938-2013.csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ixyzveqr1hemuh5/CleanData1938-2013.csv)
  - [Clean CSV Files for each year] (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0w1nbuolmdceys1/CZXLepJxPJ)

- For [Analyzers subgroup #2](https://github.com/taywon/ETAS_subgroup2) running the ETAS model in R specifically, we will try to convert the clear data into a "ppx". 
   - [PPX](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/spatstat/docs/ppx): a dataframe with spatio-temporal observations 
   - In this case time, it is a dataframe containns long, lat, mag, mag.type, depth, ref, date, as well as a specified domain of data. 
   - Examples: 20th century earthquakes [iran.quakes](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/ETAS/docs/iran.quakes)
               Earthquakes of Japan [jap.quakes](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/ETAS/docs/jap.quakes)

2) MEASURABLE

- Figured out how to force-push a file on GitHub despite the file limit; therefore, other groups have access to clean data that can be read into R and python

3) ATTAINABLE

- Yes, because we finished :)

4) RELEVANT

- We looked at an alternative (Google Spreadsheet) but it didnâ€™t work out. 

5) TIME-BOUND

- Saturday, we met up together during Office Hours to discuss our roles in the project and what we had accomplished
