S.M.A.R.T Goals
===============
1) SPECIFIC
- Figure out format requirement for the paper.
- Keep a narrative of what every group is doing for the project.

2) MEASURABLE
- Contact Professor Stark, Aaron, Kristina, Chris, and Danielle to figure out what type of journals that we might be submitting our paper to.
- Figure out the paper format requirement for these journals by getting ahold of these journals in the library.

3) ATTAINABLE
- This is dependant upon outside factors such as waiting for Professor Stark to get back to us concerning what journals he 
  would want us to publish the paper in. Nonetheless, we can work on other aspects of the paper while waiting for the professor's
  response.

4) RELEVANT
- One of our class goals is to have a paper produced by the end of the class.
- We want to keep a narrative of what we are doing as a class.

5) TIME-BOUND
- We have reached out to Aaron, Kristina, and Danielle, who have reached out to Professor Stark concerning the format
  requirement for the paper.
- Next class we plan on communicating with other groups on keeping a narrative of what everyone is working on.

ROADBLOCKS
------------
-Professor Stark has still not gotten back to us about what format we should use to structure the paper.
